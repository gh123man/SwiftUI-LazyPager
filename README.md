# LazyPager for SwiftUI

A buttery smooth, lazy loaded, panning, zooming, and gesture dismissible view pager view for SwiftUI. 

The goal of this package is to expose a simple SwiftUI interface for a fluid and seamless content viewer. Unlike other pagers for SwiftUI - this is built on top of UIKit APIs exposing features not yet available in SwiftUI.

The above example is from [dateit](https://dateit.com/) demonstrating the capabilities of this library. Note: the overlay is custom and can be added by putting `LazyPager` inside a `ZStack`.

# Usage

## Add the Swift Package

1. Right click on your project -> `Add Package`
2. In the search bar paste: `https://github.com/gh123man/LazyPager`
3. Click `Add Package`

Or add the package to your `Package.swift` if your project is a Swift package.


## Examples

### Simple Example
A simple image pager that displays images by name from your app assets.

```swift 
@State var data = [ ... ]

var body: some View {
    LazyPager(data: data) { element in
        Image(element)
            .resizable()
            .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
    }
}
```

That's it!

### Detailed Example

```swift 
@State var data = [ ... ]
@State var show = true
@State var opacity: CGFloat = 1 // Dismiss gesture background opacity 
@State var index = 0

var body: some View {
    Button("Open") {
        show.toggle()
    }
    .fullScreenCover(isPresented: $show) {

        // Provide any list of data and bind to an index
        LazyPager(data: data, page: $index) { element in

            // Supports any kind of view - not only images
            Image(element)
                .resizable()
                .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
        }

        // Make the content zoomable
        .zoomable(min: 1, max: 5)

        // Enable the swipe to dismiss gesture and background opacity control
        .onDismiss(backgroundOpacity: $opacity) {
            show = false
        }

        // Handle single tap gestures
        .onTap {
            print("tap")
        }

        // Get notified when to load more content
        .shouldLoadMore {
            data.append("foobar")
        }
        
        // Get notified when swiping past the beginning or end of the list 
        .overscroll { position in
            if position == .beginning {
                print("Swiped past beginning")
            } else {
                print("Swiped past end")
            }
        }

        // Handle double tap gestures
        .onDoubleTap {
            print("double tap")
        }
        
        // Handle drag events initiated by the user
        .onDrag {
            print("Drag")
        }

        // Set the spacing between pages
        .pageSpacing(20)

        // Set the background color with the drag opacity control
        .background(.black.opacity(opacity))

        // A special included modifier to help make fullScreenCover transparent
        .background(ClearFullScreenBackground())
        
        // Works with safe areas or ignored safe areas
        .ignoresSafeArea()
    }
}
```

#### Vertical paging

```swift 
@State var data = [ ... ]

var body: some View {
    LazyPager(data: data, direction: .vertical) { element in
        Image(element)
            .resizable()
            .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)
    }
}
```

# Features

- All content is lazy loaded. By default content is pre-loaded 3 elements ahead and behind the current index. 
- Display any kind of content - not just images! 
- Horizontal or Vertical paging.
- Lazy loaded views are disposed when they are outside of the pre-load frame to conserve resources. 
- Enable zooming and panning with `.zoomable(min: CGFloat, max: CGFloat)`.
- Double tap to zoom is also supported through `.zoomable` modifier.
- Notifies when to load more content with `.shouldLoadMore`.
- Notifies when you swipe past the beginning or end of data with `.overscroll`.
- Animate page transitions by using `withAnimation` when changing the page index. 
- Works with `.ignoresSafeArea()` (or not) to get a true full screen view.
- Drag to dismiss is supported with `.onDismiss` - Supply a binding opacity value to control the background opacity during the transition. 
- Tap events are handled internally, so use `.onTap` to handle single taps (useful for hiding and showing UI).
- Use `.onDoubleTap` to get notified on double taps.
- Use `.settings` to [modify advanced settings](https://github.com/gh123man/SwiftUI-LazyPager/blob/master/Sources/LazyPager/LazyPager.swift#L73).
- Use `.absoluteContentPosition` to subscribe to content position updates (the index + the offset while paging)
- Use `.onZoom` to get notified of the current zoom level
- Use `.onDrag` to handle drag events when the user interacts with the view. No triggered when page is changed programmatically.
- Use `.pageSpacing(CGFloat)` to set the spacing between pages.

# Detailed usage

## Working with `fullScreenCover`

`fullScreenCover` is a good native element for displaying a photo browser, however it has an opaque background by default that is difficult to remove. So `LazyPager` provides a `ClearFullScreenBackground` background view you can use to fix it. Simply add `.background(ClearFullScreenBackground())` to the root element of your `fullScreenCover`. This makes the pull to dismiss gesture seamless. 

## Double tap to zoom
You can customize the double tap behavior using the `zoomable(min: CGFloat, max: CGFloat, doubleTapGesture: DoubleTap)`. By default `doubleTapGesture` is set to `.scale(0.5)` which means "zoom 50% when double tapped". You can change this to a different ratio or set it to `.disabled` to disable the double tap gesture. 

## Dismiss gesture handling 
By default `.onDismiss` will be called after the pull to dismiss gesture is completed. It is often desirable to fade out the background in the process. `LazyPager` uses a fully transparent background by default so you can set your own custom background. NOTE: `.onDismiss` is only supported for `.horizontal` pagers.

To control the dismiss opacity of a custom background, use a `Binding<CGFloat>` like `.onDismiss(backgroundOpacity: $opacity) {` to fade out your custom background.
